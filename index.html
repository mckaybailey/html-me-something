      <h1>Music</h1>

      <p class="content" id="special">Music was probably the most fun hobby that I've had, but also the least
        lucritive. It is not easy to make a lot of money doing music, but you can learn a lot from mastering the
        technique neccesary to play an instrument. The investment I made in music mostly paid off because it was a
        satisfying way to learn something difficult. I've done it since the fourth grade and learned how to play piano,
        tuba, guitar, bass, and ukelele.</p>

    <article class="subjects">
      <h1>School</h1>

        alt="When you confidenly blurt our the answer and its wrong af" style="width:25%; height:300px">
      <p class="content">I've always been naturally good at the random stuff they had me do at school even though I was
        not particularly interested in all of it. Eventually, I got used to not needing to really try on my homework,
        but then I got to the more confusing classes and realized that even if you are smart, anything worth its time
        is going to take time to learn. I realized this once it was too late. For my last two years of highschool, I
        went to a local community college and my calculus teacher did not assign homework. I thought I was smart enough
        to just not do it, but then I would not have time to do all the problems that I did not practice. I learned my
        lesson with a C, but I was still happy to pass the class unlike the other half of students who ended up
        dropping.</p>

      <h1>Computers</h1>
      <img src="https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-avRlUAEB8aw%2FUd4oeZ-E4CI%2FAAAAAAAABCY%2F5LQ0aB4h8ug%2Fs1600%2Fi.jpg&f=1"
        alt="Z1 one of the first mechanical computers" style="width:25%; height:250px">
      <p class="content">I feel like a lot of older people have an incoherent understanding of computers. I'm not
        saying that older people are bad with them, just more seperated. Growing up, I was surrounded by computers.
        Consequently, I was more likely to understand them and get good at using them. When I was little, I felt
        special when people would ask me for the wifi password because I had the random bunch of numbers memorized.</p>
